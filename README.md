Repository for the Bachelor Thesis conducted during FS22

The thesis is an implementation of the articles "Sliding Token on Bipartite Permutation Graphs" and "Bipartite Permutation Graphs" into Python.
The entire workflow checks input data for: Bipartite Graphs, Permutation Graphs, Independent Sets, Rigid Tokens and Reconfigurability between Independent sets,
concluding in  the output of a reconfiguration sequence.

For more in depth detail, the accompanying research paper and the original articles are to be considered most valuable.
